									<h1>  The Ocean</br> Sings </h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
Imagine a large ocean, vast and expansive. The wind in your hair and the sand between your toes. Imagine the waves circling you, gliding around skin. Imagine dark skies, crickets as your only companion at this hour. But that doesnt mean you see them, they’re a backdrop to the rushing of waves. A harmony on which the ocean sings on. And sing it does. 
</br>
You stop existing in that moment, the body only a vessel to which you watch the spectacle of being. If you take enough steps you’ll feel the sand catch in your elbows. More and you’ll be fully submerged. More and suddenly theres seaweed clinging to you.
</br>
But you dont. You stay and sit and be. Just existing in the moment. The waves wash everything away, your thoughts your mind. Somehow, that only makes everything More. Here with no thoughts to accompany you, here is where i think the most. Where i start getting philosophical, where i start reciting prose and thinking of poems ive only read once. 
</br>
Previously i only had those thoughts there, in the ocean’s grasp. Imagine my surprise when i wake up in morning dew, and am bombarded by that feeling once more as i listen to your laugh. Something so sacred to me, so precious and rare and fleeting. Suddenly so close to my reach. Something that only existed on far away nights at the peak of my loneliness is now here in morning light and grinning at me like i deserve it. I decide to be selfish, to take it with bleeding hands, how then, are you not stained red? How come my hand is filled with glass shards but none have scraped you? How come i feel whole?
</br>
You make me be, you make me human in a way that doesnt come naturally to me. Is it sacrilegious to call it enlightenment? I cant think of anything else it could be, when your smile makes me feel saved.
