I should be working. Theres so much to do and so little time. But i guess this is why people say love is so distracting huh? Why schools dont allow dating. It really does take so much of your brain space. </br>
Maybe it’ll be in japan, maybe it’ll be new york. It’ll be a big city certainly, thats where we’re most comfortable.  an apartment building, with a balcony. We would learn to cook but take out is always so easy. Would proximity matter? I like long train rides, but i think having to wait so long to get back to you everyday would hurt me more than i could imagine. I would want my own space, a room of my own. Wouldnt have to be big, im used to cramped conditions. We would very different methods of decorating probably. Living with younger siblings has taught me to enjoy bold colors and make my life a mismatch of pebbles i like. I would put your art on the walls, my office would be lined with them in every corner. It would be a guest bedroom if we had people over. We both like having piles off soft squishy items on our beds, that wouldnt be a hard conversation. We would both have to learn how to cook, how to do laundry and clean. Well maybe just me. </br>
There would always be fruit on the table, a habit ive picked up over the years. It would be nice if we shared the first train line.
