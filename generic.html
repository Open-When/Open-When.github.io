									<h1>Happy 1-year </br> Anniversary</h1>
									<p> I really was at a lost at what to do for our first anniversary, nothing felt appropriately large and grand enough. My first thought was to send a bouquet of roses to your place but then I realised the uh- technical issues with that. Eventually I landed up here, because if nothing else I know I can code decently well and I’m good enough at writing.
</p>

The website idea had been in the works for a while now, 1 month after we got together was when I first started playing around with the idea. But I very quickly realised that if I wanted to code a website from scratch it would take longer than 2 weeks. 
</br></br>
The whole point of this is to make it real, if I can’t send you something physical for our anniversary I want to at least give you a way to visualise it, hold it, see it, understand the effect you've had on me to the extent to which my mind is consumed. Each piece on this site is taken from that giant word document where I write about you, I hand-picked the most down-bad ones to put on display. The hours I spent putting this together are nowhere near the hours you take up in my mind (which im certainly not complaining about)
</p>


								<p>I don’t know how to make this sound not desperate and clingy and just ever so slightly obsessive. But I wouldn’t really be me if I took it away huh, I am desperate, I am clingy, I am a bit more than slightly obsessed. This time I’ll embrace that</br></br>

Which- isn’t something I would’ve done years ago. I would’ve pushed it all down as far it could go until all that was left was an empty shell of love. You’ve made me shameless, you’ve taken my heart into your hands and breathed life into it. Sometimes I still feel like a newborn deer, looking at the world so full of love and life for the first time, with shaking legs barely able to keep up with my desire to explore it all.
</p>




<p>
I don’t know if I ever told you how much you changed me. It’d be more accurate to say you inspired me- honestly. You were so straightforward, so sincere and honest. For the first time I felt like I was chasing something, your attention. It sounds so stupid now but back then I wanted nothing more than your eyes on me, still kinda do honestly. At first I tried lying, building myself up to be this grand person, but you saw through it so fast. Then I tried playing meek victim, and you matched it with actual vulnerability. I ran out of tricks so quickly, and when I gave up, when I decided to just be honest and real and contradictory- you smiled at me. 

You laughed with me, you looked at me, and at the moment I didn’t have the words for it. All I knew was that you were the only thing my mind could focus on, and that I wanted to chase the sound of your laugh for as long as I could. 

</p>

I used to be terrified of commitment, weird huh. If you’ve read through the rest of the posts on this site, you’d think I was some hopeless romantic, Romeo Juliet type, waiting for love to sweep me off my feet. But no, that was a recent development. For the longest time it terrified me, the idea that someone could know me so well and I had no way to escape them. Trauma brain- you know how it is. It used to paralyze me sometimes, sitting there unwilling to move, like if I played dead for long enough the grasping fear would let me go. I’d like to think I’ve moved on from that. I’ll admit, when I think about spending my later years with you 
</br></br>
I’m not used to being honest. Lying has been a coping mechanism of mine for so long it felt wrong to ever be truthful. But for you, for you I wanted to be. Part of it was definitely just me wanting to have your attention, but another part of me wanted it just for the sake of it, for the sake of being someone I could be proud of. I had tried so many times to get rid of my compulsive lying but everytime I would run back to it, to the safety of it. And then I met you, I’m not sure what magic you’ve got going on but it gave me strength, conviction in myself. It wasn’t that I felt any safer, but that for the first time- my drive was overpowering my fear.
</br></br>
I’ve said it once, I’ll say it again and a million times over. Loving you feels like breathing for the first time. It feels like seeing the world through a budget camera lens and breathing out a sigh because yes, the world is that beautiful, how could I have possibly been so blind to it. Falling in love with you feels like waking up under blankets and cold mornings, it feels new and familiar and for once I can see it all- the way the universe sings in all the small ways.
</br></br>

Darling, you’re going to be something great. I’m so proud of you, getting to see your growth first-hand is exhilarating. The quiet way you’d grow, you’d change. I’ll admit in the beginning it scared me, this overwhelming realisation that you would most certainly pass me by. You’re devoted, beyond what I ever thought possible. It inspired me- well more like it kicked me out of the comfortable space of stagnation I was in. I was so focused on becoming stable that I’d neglected all the opportunities that fell into my lap. But if I wanted to catch up to you, if I wanted to stay by your side through it all then I’d need to start putting in the work.
</br></br>
I’m competitive, in the past it’s gotten me into trouble. With you, it becomes salvation, ambition and drive and. It’s odd. So much of this is odd, new and terrifying and. When I was young I never imagined I would have a future, maybe it was the suicidal thoughts, maybe it was short-sightedness, but any mention of a future was pushed aside for the immediate now. For the first time I’m sitting here searching up bus schedules for an art museum and its wishful thinking, I know, but isn’t that magical? That for once I feel free enough to wish

</p>



<p>
There’s a lot more I could say, a lot I probably should say. About how grateful I am that you’ve chosen to be there for me, to be safety and consistency wrapped in kindness. I could talk about how terrifying long distance has been, how my mind spirals without your presence to calm it down. I could talk about the thousand and 1 ways you've changed me as a person, the millions ways I look at you and wonder how I got lucky. 
</br></br>
But- I’ll keep my cards for another day, I think I’ve embarrassed myself enough today what with all the ramblings.
</br></br>
Have a good day darlin, </br>
Love you
