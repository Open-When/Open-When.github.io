								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>i dont believe. i pray rarely, only when the need strikes me or when i feel the pull. i dont know what i did last night, if it were a prayer or a plea. but i thanked them, all of them, whichever one would accept it. i thanked them for allowing me to have you in my life. i thanked them for listening </br>
because years ago, when i was young i remember hoping, begging, for someone with a soft smile and open arms. for someone with a voice like doves and eyes like the sun. its been years since then, the doves have lost their lusters and the sun only half as bright as it was when i was swimming in puddles. But i would recognize it with my eyes closed, the curve of your lips the lilt in your voice. i look at you and think of summers ago and summers to be, i look at you and think of a lonely past and hope for a less lonely future. </br>
“dream come true” always seemed like an exaggeration, exacerbated for effect. sweet nothings whispered on drunken nights when the words mean so much but hold so little. its 3pm on a Tuesday, the world at my finger tips. and yet i cannot find a sentence that better describes what i feel. you are the mist of memories come together, clouds of dreams formed into a person. i think i have always loved her, i think i always will.
