I don’t have the words for it, odd right? When all I do is weave words together, how come I can never find the right string to describe it, this overwhelming feeling in my chest, how come I cant ever get the words out. how she shines, something soft and gentle. how she laughs, rich and echoing. how she sings, sweet and angelic. so many words but how do i invoke the image of her, how would i describe her to someone who has never met her, would i be able to do her justice? </br>
conciseness, simplicity, its what makes people feel but 3 words are not going to be enough, how could they be. how do i explain the depth of her, how could i ever describe her well enough. i feel like an artist from the renaissance, with a muse so beautiful all my art revolves around depicting them. but of all those artists, their factual, nearly identical portraitures arent what keeps rhe memory of these woman alive, you do not remember the girl from the way her hair is smoothly pulled back, you remember her for the pearl in her ear, for the fear and apprehension in her face. the unspeakable, the unknowable, the subconscious, the humanity. that is what is remembered. </br>
Is this how they felt? So desperate in their attempt to understand it? I would like to think so, I’d like to think this is why they produced so much, not due to some quota but because they couldnt stop themselves until they managed to succeed in portraying all the details that a camera couldnt.
